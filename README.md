# Gimoji

I like to put an ~~emoji~~ at the front of every commit that I :pushpin: on Github.
> _See any repo I run for proof._

 I don't care what they are, I just like to do it, because the visual element is way better than any words can be. Descriptions are good to write, but not commit messages. They should just be **emojis**. :triumph:

Still, it's hard to actually :think: when I need them! :disappointed: 


This :shit: is :no_good: :exclamation:

**So I made a thing that will get you what you want, quick!**

Usage
----------------

If you have `moji.py` saved in the user site-packages folder, this will work from anywhere.

```bash
python -m moji
```

Otherwise, you'll have to call it from the folder you've got it saved in. Open a terminal there, and just type
```bash
moji
```

---

By just typing the above command, you'll just get 1 emoji from the whole selection of them. _But if you add a number after_, **baby, now we're cooking with** :fire:

**But wait! There's more!**



Arguments
