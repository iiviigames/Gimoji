# Gimoji

I like to put an ~~emoji~~ at the front of every commit that I :pushpin: on Github.
> _See any repo I run for proof._

 I don't care what they are, I just like to do it, because the visual element is way better than any words can be. Descriptions are good to write, but not commit messages. They should just be **emojis**. :triumph:

Still, it's hard to actually :think: when I need them! :disappointed: 


This :shit: is :no_good: :exclamation:

**So I made a thing that will get you what you want, quick!**

Usage
----------------

If you have `moji.py` saved in the user site-packages folder, this will work from anywhere.

```bash
python -m moji
```

Otherwise, you'll have to call it from the folder you've got it saved in. Open a terminal there, and just type
```bash
moji
```

---

By just typing the above command, you'll just get 1 emoji from the whole selection of them. _But if you add a number after_, **baby, now we're cooking with** :fire:


> If you use the `emoji.bat` file included in this repo, and place it in a Shortcuts folder, or somewhere on the PATH, then you can even call this without `python -m`

**But wait! There's more!**



Arguments and Help
-------------------

```bash
python -m moji -h
```
will produce some assitance for you , like so:

Getting Emojis from specific Groups
------------------------------------

These are the categories I have the emojis grouped into:

|Category |Command| Description          |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
|All      |`-a`   |_everything_          |
|Emotes   |`-e`   |_people_               |
|Nature   |`-n`   |_the great outdoors_   |
|Places   |`-p`   |_man made_     :shit:  |
|Symbols  |`-s`   |_all the weird and miscellaneous_|
