# Gimoji

I like to put an emoji at the front of every commit on Github, as you might see above. I don't care what they are, I just like to do it.

Well, it's hard to remember them all, so I made a thing that will get you what you want, quick.

Usage
----------------

If you have `moji.py` saved in the user site-packages folder, this will work from anywhere.

```bash
python -m moji
```

Otherwise, you'll have to call it from the folder you've got it saved in. Open a terminal there, and just type
```bash
moji
```

Arguments
-------------------
